## Key Objective of Project 4:
Create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Project should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication. Choose from the 3 different data sets:
- Flight Delays and Cancellations
- US Census Demographic Data
- YouTube data from the US
<br>

## Project Requirement:
Criteria: 
- A clear finding for the visualization.
- Selected findings should be clearly communicated and easy to understand.
<br>

Design:
- The written summary should reflect what a reader would interpret from the graphic.
- Data visualization should incorporate interaction, animation, colors and plots appropriately.
<br>

Completeness:
- Provide 3 visualizations which link to dashboards on Tableau Public.
- Each visual has a written response from the insights gained.
- Across the 3 visualizations, 3 different types of charts are used.
